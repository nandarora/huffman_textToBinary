# huffman_textToBinary
Huffman coding project to convert text to binary

It converts the sampletest.txt to a binary file.

Run the file "useHuffman.py" (which will call "huffmancalled.py") to get the result and store the result in sampletest.bin file.

To read the .bin file use any binary viewer software e.g. hxD (can be downloaded from: https://download.cnet.com/HxD-Hex-Editor/3000-2352_4-10891068.html )

It will give the following result for the presently written sampletest.txt:

04 B8 ED 6C EA 3F B7 51 D4 6B 45 F8 BB 13 08 C3 FB 75 1D 45 B0 EF 79 22 94 99 66 D7 3C F8 3C 6E 60 43 38 9B CF 8F C7 29 7D 7B 13 C5 77 B4 13 B3 4F 2F D5 30 C0

Note: The result will change is you change the text in sampletest.txt
